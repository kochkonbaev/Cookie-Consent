- Performs your preferred action (accept/decline) or waits for manual input

2. In "Decline" mode:
- Monitors for non-essential cookies
- Alerts you about potential GDPR violations

## Technical Details

- **Storage**: Uses `chrome.storage.sync` for settings and `chrome.storage.local` for domain-specific data
- **Content Scripts**: Injects scripts to interact with cookie banners
- **Permissions**:
- `cookies`: For GDPR compliance checking
- `notifications`: To alert users
- `storage`: To save preferences

- May not detect all GDPR violations perfectly
- Requires refresh after consent action for full effect
